Everyday social life - our thoughts, actions, feelings, decisions, and interactions- is the product of a complex interplay between societal forces and personal characteristics.

- the study of the social causes of human behavior.  
- the scientific study of the patterns and processes of human social relations.  
- the systematic study of how people and their personal, everyday experiences affect and are affected by the larger society and its social structures and social processes.

- "How are the things that we take to be natural actually socially constructed?"

### Why study sociology?
@snap[text-09]
@ol[text-08](false)
- It helps us see the world from many different perspectives and improves our understanding about people who are different from us.
- It facilitates a better self-understanding about who we are as individuals and what factors have shaped our lives. If we know how society works, we have a better chance of influencing our futures both individually and collectively.
- It helps us to better recognize and understand social problems so that solutions can be found.

**Social structures** are patterns of behavior that are repeated over and over until they become an established part of society.
