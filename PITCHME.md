Everyday social life - our thoughts, actions, feelings, decisions, and interactions- is the product of a complex interplay between societal forces and personal characteristics.

### Why study sociology?
@snap[]
@ol[text-08](false)
- It helps us see the world from many different perspectives and improves our understanding about people who are different from us.
- It facilitates a better self-understanding about who we are as individuals and what factors have shaped our lives. If we know how society works, we have a better chance of influencing our futures both individually and collectively.
- It helps us to better recognize and understand social problems so that solutions can be found.
